# Color Palette

This is a color palette generator that generates random hex codes and allows the user to copy the code to their clipboard.

## Description
A simple project to practice JS. Working with loops, event listeners, and DOM interaction. No dependencies. Uses simple loops to generate hex codes.

## Technology

HTML, 
CSS, 
Vanilla JS

## Roadmap

In the future, I might implement the ability to freeze certain colors to allow the user to have more control over their palette. Also, add some error handling.
